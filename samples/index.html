        <h1>Developer Samples</h1>
        <p>
             After setting up xmla4js on your system, you can start using these samples:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Synchronous examples:
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <a href="discover-schema-rowsets.html">discover-schema-rowsets.html</a> - A basic example showing how to use Xmla.js to do synchronous retrieval of OLAP metadata.
                        This sample uses various flavours of the Discover method and renders the results as HTML tables.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <a href="discover-synchronous.html">discover-synchronous.html</a> - 
                        The sample lets you enter a URL for a XML/A webservice, and then visualizes the metadata in a dynamic treeview, allowing you to hierarchically explore datasources, catalogs, cubes, dimensions, hierarchies, levels, members and properties.
                        This sample illustrates how to apply Restrictions to the XML/A Discover method. 
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <a href="rowset-examples.html">rowset-examples.html</a> - Xmla4js offers great flexibility in the ways to obtain data from the Xmla provider.
                        The goal is to make it as easy as possible to directly use that data for third party visualization libraries and the like, with no or little hand-written processing and/or iteration.
                        This sample illustrates various methods for iterating through and extracting data from a Xmla.Rowset
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <a href="execute-synchronous.html">execute-synchronous.html</a> - 
                        This sample illustrates how to select a XML/A datasource, send MDX queries, and retrieve and traverse the multidimensional resultset. 
                        This sample uses synchronous requests.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <a href="execute-synchronous-mddataset-adg.html">execute-synchronous.html</a> - 
                        This <a href="http://code.google.com/p/xmla4js/issues/detail?id=6">reproduces issue 6</a>.
                    </li>

                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                Asynchronous examples
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <a href="discover-asynchronous.html">discover-asynchronous.html</a> - 
                        This sample illustrates how to get XML/A metadata asynchronously.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <a href="execute-asynchronous.html">execute-asynchronous.html</a> - 
                        This sample illustrates how to select a XML/A datasource, send MDX queries, and retrieve and traverse the multidimensional resultset. 
                        This sample uses synchronous requests.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>

These samples will be done at a later time
            <li>
                <a href="google-visualization.html">google-visualization.html</a> - 
                This sample illustrates how to use the tabular results of the execute method to render a pie-chart
            </li>
            <li>
                <a href="google-visualization-wizard.html">google-visualization-wizard.html</a> - 
                This sample illustrates how to render google visualizations using data obtained from an XML/A execute request.
            </li>
-->            
            <li>
                Combination Examples

                        XML/A shell. Because real men use the command line.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <a href="yui-chart-wizard.html">yui-chart-wizard.html</a> - 
                        This sample illustrates how to render a YUI chart using data obtained from an XML/A execute request.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <a href="pivot-table.html">pivot-table.html</a> - 
                        This sample illustrates how to handle raw XML response and apply an XSLT stylesheet to it to render a pivot table.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <a href="treeview-pivottable-combination.html">treeview-pivottable-combination.html</a> - 
                        This sample illustrates how to render 3 axes of a multidimensional data set in a pivot table / treeview combination.
                        Leaf nodes in the pivot table represent tuples in the 3rd query axis, and provides a selection mechanism to display a corresponding pivot table.
